# React Router Dom

In this project, I used the react-router-dom package for page routing in React and created a basic navigation area to perform page routing.

This repo can be copied and used directly.

## Features

- Router structure was used.
- Nested structure was used.
- Submenus were added to the menu.
- Different route operations were performed within the page.
